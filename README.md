I built this project to learn how to handle user roles and data visualisation in a real-world web app. It’s a tool where a team can report software bugs, set priorities, and track them until they are fixed.

What it does:-
User Roles: Admins can create projects and delete data, while Standard Users focus on reporting and resolving bugs.
Visual Dashboard: I used Chart.js to show a "Project Health" chart that updates automatically based on bug priorities.
Bug Tracking: You can report a bug, see it in the list, and mark it "Resolved" to cross it off.
Secure Login: The app uses a login system that displays the current user's name and role in the navbar.

Tech Used:-
Backend: Python & Flask
Database: SQLAlchemy & SQLite
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
